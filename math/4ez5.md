# Domain of a Function

The Set of inputs accepted by the function. Notated as $\text{dom}(f)$ where $f$ is the function.

Given a function $f:X\to Y$, the domain of $f$ is $X$.

For a function $f: X \to Y$, the set $Y$ is called the [Codomain](q9vk.md), and the set of values attained by the function (which is a subset of $Y$) is called its [Range](2b8g.md) or [Image](7871.md).
